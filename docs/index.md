# Finalizing Anticipatory Action Triggers: Key Decisions

The number of years that can trigger is limited by budgets
	- Many funders can only fund 3 out of 10 years 

The earlier stages of design result in many different triggers

- Each month could trigger in any year
- For example 
	- if April could trigger at 30% of the time
	- and if May could also trigger at 30% of the time
	- **More than 30% of the years could trigger**
- If forecasts were completely random, 
	- for 6 months, 
	- at each month set at 30%, 
	- we would expect more than 80% of the years to trigger 
	- We expect fewer because forecasts are not completely random

- **Different strategies to reduce frequency have different accuracy levels**
	- Some strategies may **increase accuracy**
	- Some strategies may **trigger earlier** in the year, giving more advance warning of disaster

Therefore, the final, perhaps most important design choices are to choose a rule to combine the different pieces in order to

- Reduce the frequency to meet funding limits
- Increase the accuracy of the forecast protocol

**In this session we will provide the most relevant options to you and ask you what finalized solution you feel is best.**
